# CoffeeScript Project Euler solutions

My attempt at solving the problems listed at http://projecteuler.net/

Using Qunit to verify results.

## To see these running, or try and do ones i've missed out..
- Clone this repo
- cd test
- mkdir qunit
- cd qunit
- curl -O https://raw.github.com/jquery/qunit/master/qunit/qunit.js
- curl -O https://raw.github.com/jquery/qunit/master/qunit/qunit.css
- Run "cake build"
- Open "index.html"
- Add tests in test/euler.coffee
- Add solutions in the coffeescript directory. If you add new files you will need to add them to the cakefile
